# ELEC5305 Project – Speech Enhancement

This project explores **speech enhancement** techniques to improve intelligibility of speech in noisy environments.  
The approach combines **classical signal processing methods** (e.g., spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering) with a **lightweight deep learning model** trained on noisy–clean speech pairs.  

The goal is to demonstrate improvements in **signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** and perceptual quality (e.g., PESQ, STOI), with code, results, and audio samples documented in this repository.
